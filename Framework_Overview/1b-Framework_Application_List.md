### 1b Framework Application Summary ###

## 1b.1 Computerized Modeling##
Definition: Theoretical simulations using computational tools to predict system behavior.

Key Characteristics:

Output: Best-guess predictions, not real-world results.

Purpose: To explore "what-if" scenarios, optimize designs, or identify trends.

Challenges: Limited by computational resources, model accuracy, and input data quality.

Framework Application:
Degradation Factor: Used to account for uncertainties in the model (e.g., incomplete data, approximations).

Disengaging Thresholds:

Computational limits: If the model exceeds 80% of available memory or processing power, disengage and simplify.

Precision: If the desired output cannot be calculated within ±5% precision, disengage and request better input data.

Example: Simulating the mass of recycled copper in a waste processing system, adjusting for uncertainties in waste composition.

## 1b.2 Theoretical Viability (Mind Boxing)##
Definition: Exploring conceptual feasibility through thought experiments and theoretical analysis.

Key Characteristics:

Output: Conceptual insights, not real-world results.

Purpose: To push boundaries, explore radical ideas, or identify theoretical limits.

Challenges: Scope creep (expanding beyond the original goal) and scope blowout (losing focus on the desired result).

Framework Application:
Degradation Factor: Used to account for theoretical uncertainties (e.g., unobserved interactions, open volumes).

Disengaging Thresholds:

Theoretical limits: If assumptions become too unrealistic (e.g., mass of input waste exceeds known material densities), disengage and revisit assumptions.

Scope control: Regularly check if the analysis aligns with the desired result to avoid scope creep.

Example: Exploring the theoretical maximum efficiency of a shredder, assuming ideal conditions and no energy losses.

## 1b.3 Engineering Feasibility##
Definition: Assessing the practicality and safety of real-world systems.

Key Characteristics:

Output: Identification of failure points, safety margins, and resource requirements.

Purpose: To ensure the system can be built and operated safely and efficiently.

Challenges: Balancing safety, cost, and performance while accounting for real-world constraints.

Framework Application:
Degradation Factor: Used to account for real-world uncertainties (e.g., manufacturing tolerances, environmental factors).

Disengaging Thresholds:

Safety margins: If calculated stress exceeds 90% of the material’s yield strength, disengage and redesign.

Resource limits: If energy consumption exceeds available power, disengage and optimize.

Example: Evaluating the safe operating conditions of a shredder, ensuring it can handle real-world waste inputs without failure.
