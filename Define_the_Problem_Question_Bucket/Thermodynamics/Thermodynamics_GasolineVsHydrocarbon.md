# Why is gasoline different than a hydrocarbon being combusted?

## Overview
In an effort to understand certain climate issues and the anger at big oil I am trying to define what makes gasoline so bad.  As I look into this the problem gets weird.  Octane is a hydrocarbon.  But Benzine is in the florine family so if combusted within Hydrocarbons in the presence of any chlorine gas would most likely result in CBC's which are wayyy worse for the environment then the simple CO2 issue.  Also Air intakes to any gas engine are at street level and atmospheric compounds at street level tend to be the heavier compounds so chlorine is heavier then most air compounds.   This is a concern I am trying to better define.

## Key Points to Explore
1. **Volume Interactions**:
   - How do the interactions between different hydrocarbon volumes in gasoline affect combustion?
   - How does the mixture of hydrocarbons create a unique energy transfer compared to a single hydrocarbon?

2. **Observer-Dependence**:
   - How does the observer’s perspective (e.g., a chemist vs. an engineer) influence the interpretation of gasoline combustion?
   - Are there differences in how the energy transfer is measured or perceived?

3. **Degradation Factors**:
   - How do computational models of gasoline combustion degrade when compared to real-world observations?
   - What variables (e.g., temperature, pressure, mixture composition) are most sensitive to degradation in these models?

4. **Real-Life Implications**:
   - Why does gasoline’s complex mixture lead to more efficient energy release compared to a single hydrocarbon?
   - How do impurities or additives in gasoline affect its combustion properties?

## Computational Challenges
- Modeling the combustion of a complex mixture like gasoline involves many variables (e.g., temperature, pressure, chemical composition), which can lead to **computational degradation**.
- The interactions between different hydrocarbons in gasoline create non-linear effects that are difficult to capture in simplified models.

## Possible Data Points
- Experimental data on the combustion efficiency of gasoline vs. single hydrocarbons.
- Measurements of temperature and pressure changes during combustion.
- Chemical analysis of gasoline’s composition and its effects on combustion.

## Independent Confirmation
- Conduct controlled experiments comparing gasoline combustion to single hydrocarbon combustion.
- Use spectroscopic analysis to measure energy release and byproducts.
- Compare results with existing research to ensure reproducibility.
