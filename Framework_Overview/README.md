Framework Overview
I Kyle Telfer, a self-taught individual exploring physics through a structured, iterative process I call the 5-step interaction: perception > interpretation > communication > interpretation > perception. With the help of AI platforms, I’m documenting and organizing known physics principles to better understand my own gaps in knowledge. My goal is to build a framework that helps me—and potentially others—navigate complex ideas by respecting observed data points and existing knowledge, without overextending their implications. This is an ongoing, evolving process, and I hope that by collaborating with others, this framework can grow into something that benefits not just me, but anyone who finds themselves grappling with similar questions.

####Core Priciples#### *Volume Interactions: Forces and interactions are reinterpreted as interactions between volumes. *Observer-Dependence: Measurements depend on the observer’s perspective. *Closed vs. Open Volumes: *Closed Volume: A volume where energy is conserved (no external energy transfer). *Open Volume: A volume where energy is not conserved or no energy can enter or exit a closed volume unless expressed as an interaction of two closed volumes within the theoretically fundamental 3d Space volume(external energy transfer occurs).
