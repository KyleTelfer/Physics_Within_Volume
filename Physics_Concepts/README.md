# Physics Concepts in the Volume Interaction Framework

This directory contains worded translations of known physics concepts reinterpreted through the lens of the **Volume Interaction Framework**. Each file explores a specific area of physics (e.g., mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics) and describes how traditional concepts are reimagined using **volume interactions**, **degradation factors**, and **observer-dependent measurements**.

The goal of these documents is to provide a conceptual foundation for the framework, which will later be resolved mathematically in other parts of the repository.

## Overview of the Volume Interaction Framework

The **Volume Interaction Framework** reinterprets physical phenomena as interactions between **volumes** rather than point particles or abstract fields. Key principles include:

- **Volume Definitions**: Volumes are regions of 3D space that can be open or closed, with properties like mass, energy, and density.
- **Degradation Factors**: A computational threshold that accounts for uncertainties and unobserved interactions within closed volumes.
- **Observer-Dependent Measurements**: Measurements depend on the observer's perspective (first-person, second-person, third-person).

This framework aims to provide a modular and intuitive way to conceptualize and model physical systems.
