### 2. Closed Volume Degradation Relative to Entropic Variables

## 2.1 Refined Concept: Degradation and Entropy

In the framework, **closed volumes** are systems where energy is conserved, and no external energy transfer occurs. However, any reference to an **open volume**, **theoretical volume**, or **measuring volume** within a calculation introduces potential degradation of the closed volume's integrity. This degradation is further influenced by **entropic variables** (\( V_{\text{entropic}} \)), which represent the unobserved or undefined interactions within the closed volume itself.

The mathematical representation of degradation relative to entropic variables captures the essence of this concept more effectively than words alone. It quantifies the cumulative impact of external references and internal uncertainties, providing a clear and precise way to adjust calculations for real-world complexities.

## Mathematical Representation of Degradation

1. **Entropic Variables (\( V_{\text{entropic}} \))**:
   - Represent the unobserved or undefined interactions within a closed volume.
   - Quantify the inherent uncertainty or entropy in the system.

2. **Degradation Factor (\( D \))**:
   - The degradation factor accounts for both:
     - External references to open or undefined volumes.
     - The entropic variables (\( V_{\text{entropic}} \)) within the closed volume.
   - The degradation factor \( D \) is modeled as:
     \[
     D = 1 - (k \cdot n + V_{\text{entropic}})
     \]
     - \( k \): Degradation per external reference.
     - \( n \): Number of external references.
     - \( V_{\text{entropic}} \): Entropic contribution to degradation.

## Example: Applying Degradation Relative to Entropic Variables

Let’s revisit the **collision example** and refine the degradation factor to include \( V_{\text{entropic}} \).

### Scenario:
Two objects, Object A (\( V_A \)) and Object B (\( V_B \)), collide elastically. The system (\( V_{\text{system}} \)) is treated as a closed volume, but the calculation references a **measuring volume** (\( V_{\text{measure}} \)) to determine velocities. Additionally, the closed volume has an entropic variable \( V_{\text{entropic}} = 0.2 \).

### Step 1: Define the Volumes

1. **Object A (\( V_A \))**:
   - Mass: \( m_A = 2 \, \text{kg} \)
   - Initial Velocity: \( v_{A, \text{initial}} = 3 \, \text{m/s} \)
   - Volume: Closed

2. **Object B (\( V_B \))**:
   - Mass: \( m_B = 3 \, \text{kg} \)
   - Initial Velocity: \( v_{B, \text{initial}} = -2 \, \text{m/s} \)
   - Volume: Closed

3. **System Volume (\( V_{\text{system}} \))**:
   - Combines \( V_A \) and \( V_B \).
   - Initially treated as a closed volume.

4. **Measuring Volume (\( V_{\text{measure}} \))**:
   - Used to measure velocities and energies.
   - Open volume (introduces degradation).

5. **Entropic Variable (\( V_{\text{entropic}} \))**:
   - Represents unobserved interactions within the closed volume.
   - \( V_{\text{entropic}} = 0.2 \).

### Step 2: Apply Degradation Relative to Entropic Variables

1. **Degradation Factor**:
   - Let \( k = 0.1 \) (10% degradation per reference to \( V_{\text{measure}} \)).
   - The calculation references \( V_{\text{measure}} \) 3 times.
   - The entropic variable \( V_{\text{entropic}} = 0.2 \).

   The degradation factor \( D \) is:
   \[
   D = 1 - (k \cdot n + V_{\text{entropic}}) = 1 - (0.1 \cdot 3 + 0.2) = 1 - (0.3 + 0.2) = 0.5
   \]
   - The closed volume's integrity is reduced to 50%.

### Step 3: Adjust the Final Results

1. **Final Velocities Without Degradation**:
   - From the previous calculation:
     \[
     v_{A, \text{final}} = -3 \, \text{m/s}, \quad v_{B, \text{final}} = 2 \, \text{m/s}
     \]

2. **Adjust for Degradation**:
   - Multiply the final velocities by the degradation factor \( D \):
     \[
     v_{A, \text{final, degraded}} = v_{A, \text{final}} \cdot D = -3 \cdot 0.5 = -1.5 \, \text{m/s}
     \]
     \[
     v_{B, \text{final, degraded}} = v_{B, \text{final}} \cdot D = 2 \cdot 0.5 = 1.0 \, \text{m/s}
     \]

### Step 4: Interpret the Degraded Results

1. **First-Person Perspective (\( V_me \))**:
   - The observed velocities are further reduced due to the inclusion of entropic variables. Object A now moves at -1.5 m/s, and Object B moves at 1.0 m/s.

2. **Third-Person Perspective (\( V \))**:
   - The absolute velocities are also reduced, reflecting the combined impact of external references and entropic variables.

## Conclusion

By incorporating **entropic variables** into the degradation framework, we account for both external references and internal uncertainties within the closed volume. This refinement ensures that the degradation factor more accurately reflects the real-world complexities of closed systems. The mathematical representation of this concept captures its essence more effectively than words alone, providing a clear and precise way to adjust calculations for real-world applications.

### Reflection on the Mathematical Representation

The mathematical representation of degradation relative to entropic variables is more than just a formula—it is a bridge between theoretical abstraction and real-world complexity. It elegantly captures the interplay between external influences and internal uncertainties, offering a way to quantify and adjust for the inherent "messiness" of physical systems. This representation not only enhances the framework's accuracy but also deepens our understanding of the underlying principles at play.
